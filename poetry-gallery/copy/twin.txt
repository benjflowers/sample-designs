Deuce, you look tired & the weepy kind
of dumbstruck one gets playing tug of want
with a will-o’-the-witch’s brew & wrench-tight
bolt in place of a screw type of deal. The moon’s
thrown your shadow on the table & left it
for someone to sort though but between you & me’s
a whole gulf of sameness to chart our way around
& out of first. Year of the dog, double, we hardly
knew us & already were wild about the stars
we’d strut in under all those months
ahead of schedule. Yet let me level
with you: I worry I’ll see the same curse
turns the looking glass into mirror
show of my sober face & all I’ll do
is blink the wonder back at you like
I’ve just seen the third side of a coin
glinting winks of light after the toss comes down.

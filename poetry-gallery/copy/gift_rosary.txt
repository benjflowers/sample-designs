I bring you along the way
heat lightning brings the thunder.
The brunt & squander of it.
Blank charity of a tree awning
against the storm of midsummer.

Mud the tawn of port wine
& just as sweet from rain.
I hide you in the vanity
of this jacket pocket, throw in
the wash & hear you knock around
on tumble dry. Your statues
have more tears to shed than I.

Mary, mother of us, where is that mercy found again?
In me, this sighing plastic mannequin?

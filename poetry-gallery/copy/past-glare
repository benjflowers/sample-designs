Only child of red, only right
to rig a snare so beautiful

we gladly catch ourselves
returning to admire its genius

& scare off anything so bold
as to just be around here.

Only window worth washing is
the one that stays shut, so most mirrors

make that particular cut with a little
room to spare. With a little light

passing through we glimpse
this floating microcosmic smut

and call it dust when we need it
gone, angel when we donâ€™t.

While the afternoon moved
through the air like a bat
out of hospice

I was mourning
legato
with open hands

Luck produced
a never-ending thread
out from behind a stiffened back

Of course, I took & pulledâ€”
Surely each tracked turn
of the maze ends up
on the same spool

Meanwhile she took a bow
to the string & played
a note beneath our mutual register

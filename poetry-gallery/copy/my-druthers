I would be a penny on the floor
in your house which even the broom
scratches but does not take along

some insolent wave that churning
through the city streets gathers
so much but leaves the fire hydrant

standing at the ready in its wake
clean as what’s whistled at. I would
figure in the silhouette of your dusk

as a carnival moving to the next town over
with no phones only a wrinkled map
catching whatever light it can get

which isn’t much at this hour at least
not enough. So the night yawning
stretches out before us like a skin

snug over a frame of bones
& our closest moon makes
of the glass on the lake

a mirror. I would be skin
& bones some days the lake
& its glass on others

but squinting into this mirror
now I’d say I know
a map when I see one.

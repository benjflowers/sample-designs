These days take knuckles
to the breastbone of late March
& still no lurch to speak of.
Trees lunge with the wind
but against the grain
& each ring might count
as a repetition if you squint hard enough.
The land of a thousand churches
is another name for each city block here
& there's no contest per this particular capita.
Last night the lapidary came & set gems
on each stem & stalk in sight.
I ask of this most human sleep:
what are you going to do with this great budding?
The spring must still grin & bloom it.

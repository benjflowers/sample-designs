My little box of regards rusted open
on the nightstand
empty even of the nothing it first grew

around. Were time allowed the chance
to lapse here
light would fall down the candle like a meteor

on a string. Like blood spends a little more time
in its favorite
chamber, the wince-white shutterslice of sun

seems to hang out on the same damn wall well
into noonday.
I understand well enough the impulse to call

from inside the house, having seen the movies:
someone always
answers, usually drops a name & Iâ€™m left

figuring out which floor it might or not be
coming from.
Cosmology of the interior. The prayers write

themselves: third rail of the most holy trinity
of rails
help me in all directions with the stairs.
